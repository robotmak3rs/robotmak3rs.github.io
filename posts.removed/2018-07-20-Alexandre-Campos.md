## Bio

Having always been fascinated with robots and LEGO bricks, receiving his Robotics Invention System 9747 in 1999 was a defining moment and a definitive contribution to his choice of following an education in Electrical Engineering.
His favourite area of robotics is mobility: mobile robots, exploration, and unusual forms of locomotion. He is a regular contributor to the robotics area of PLUG events, entertaining visitors with demonstrations of the robots present.
