## Bio


Francois Dubuc was born with a keyboard in his hands; he wrote his first game at 9 years old and was published for the first time at 14. He wrote his first commercial software at 15. He started his first software company at 28 and sold it at 38. Since then, Francois left his dark age and solidly felt in love with MINDSTORMS. He’s a robot builder of more than 30 big projects.

Today, Francois’s primary focus is having fun developing mobile video games, building robots and teaching robotics in two different schools, starting as early as grade 3 up to high school students. He’s also the acting President of QueLUG, President of LPA Foundation, Founder at MobeeDream.com, Director in a software company (part time), Owner at MillionPrints.com and business mentor.
