## Bio

Kyle Markland is a young robotics enthusiast and aspiring engineer who is committed to helping others learn about technology. In 2015, he started a weekly series of robotics tutorials on his YouTube channel "Builderdude35." The videos aim to teach viewers engineering and programming concepts such as PID line following, dog gears, and pneumatics. Since then, he has helped represent LEGO MINDSTORMS at events such as the World Maker Faire in NYC, the LEGO Learning Symposium at Tufts University, and LEGO LIVE 2018. In recognition of his efforts in robotics education, LEGO MINDSTORMS officially named Kyle an MINDSTORMS Community Partner (MCP) in August 2017.

Kyle published his book Building Smart LEGO MINSTORMS EV3 Robots in April 2018. The book is a project-based guide aimed at intermediate-level robotics enthusiasts that explains the engineering behind six of his most popular robots. Kyle is currently an undergraduate at MIT where he studies materials engineering and simulation. He also composes for his independent music project, called Lenseye.
