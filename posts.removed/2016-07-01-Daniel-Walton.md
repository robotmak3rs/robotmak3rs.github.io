## Bio


Daniel was introduced to MINDSTORMs in 2013 and has since then become a big fan.  He uses ev3dev for all of his builds and is one of the maintainers of the ev3dev python library.  His favorite robot is CraneCuber which is a Rubiks Cube solving robot that is a mashup of an EV3 and 42009 Mobile Crane MK II. CraneCuber can solve 2x2x2 up to 6x6x6 rubiks cubes.  It is by far his most complicated build, it took many months to write all of the software for it.
