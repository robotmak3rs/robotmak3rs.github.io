## Bio

After graduating college with a Computer
Engineering degree, Kevin worked for 18
years at Amdahl Corporation, in various
roles including verification and validation
engineer, CAD tool developer and chip
designer. Kevin then spent 18 years at Sun/
Oracle doing post-silicon validation for
SPARC processor servers. Most recently
Kevin joined Apple Corporation as a
validation engineer, writing tests in Arm
assembly language. <br>

Kevin started playing with Mindstorms when
they were first introduced. He’s co-authored
three books with building instructions for a
total of 7 robots made using RIS and Dark
Side Developers Kit. Kevin specializes in
walkers, especially bipeds (lots of versions of Star Wars AT-ST). The titles
include two “Ten Cool Robots” books, one for DSDK and the other for RIS.
He also was a co-author for “Mindstorms Masterpieces”, with instructions
for MOCs involving Mindstorms and Technic pneumatics.
Kevin was asked and agreed to be an MCP. Kevin was heavily involved in
analyzing and giving feedback to National Instruments about their
revolutionary graphical programming language G.
Along the way, Kevin has been a significant developer for the LDraw family
of CAD tools. Kevin wrote LPub, a WYSIWYG program that dramatically
simplifies the creation of building instructions. LPub has has been used by
the authors of a majority of the Mindstorms books available today, and the
bulk of the instructions made by fans over the last 15 years. Kevin also
wrote LSynth to allow for the use of bendable parts like hoses, electric
cables, and rubber bands in LDraw models. Kevin won the James
Jessiman award for his efforts. Kevin was a co-author in the book
Software Power Tools, that described how the Draw family of tools work,
and how to use them to make building instructions.<br>
