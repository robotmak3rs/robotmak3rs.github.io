## Bio

Harald combines his day job as offshore technician with his passion for LEGO and STEAM education.
A hobby that started with just being a LEGO collector got more depth when the first RCX drove towards his house and he soon became a FIRST LEGO League coach for the local high school.
In an effort to reach out STEAM to more potential little engineers, Harald started giving workshops on big events with the idea of 'students teaching students' in mind. During LEGOWORLD Utrecht in 2019, 1700 children made their first steps in Robotics and Coding during the WeDo and Mindstorms workshops provided by Harald and his Dutch Delta Robotics team.
In 2018, together with several more educators, Harald brought World Robot Olympiad to the Netherlands.
While still being that AFOL, Harald also likes to built big driving Mindstorms robots.
