## Bio


When I was little, I started out building Duplo and then translated into Lego when I was 4 years old. In the beginning I was building with instructions, but when I got older, I began to reverse engineer Lego creations that I found on the internet. I began to reverse engineer Lego creations that wasnâ€™t too complicated, but as I got older, I started to build bigger and more complex models. Many of the models I have reverse engineered uses Mindstorms, motors, pneumatic and mechanical mechanisms. The knowledge and experience I gained through reverse engineering made me more inspired to make my own creations.
